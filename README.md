# Headless Content Served Through Nuxt

> A template that displays content from any API through Nuxt JS

### Content

> Content is delivered via WordPress. However, any API can be consumed and configured with any number of app functions. 

### Purpose of Nuxt

> Nuxt has some key features that make it easy to display and navigate through dense amount of content (such as Blogs, Magazines, Product Info). Those features are: out-of-the-box routing via Vue files in /pages, easy Vuex store integration to supply states and control in the application, dynamic content routing with underscore vue files (ex: _/blog/index.vue, _slug.vue), and static folder setup in environment. This make it key for dynamic page routing for things such as dynamic blog posts and user pages as well as all the features of Vue.js.
